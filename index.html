            <p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Have fun with it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. In this world, everything can be happy. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.
            </p>

            <p>We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.You were given this gift of imagination. Use it! With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.</p>


            <p>Just make little strokes like that. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>
